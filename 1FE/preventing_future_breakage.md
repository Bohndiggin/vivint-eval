# HOW TO PREVENT FUTER ISSUES #

Preventing future breakages is done by a few practices.

1. RELATIVITY - Use relative sizing where possible.
2. UNIQUENESS - Use unique names for your id's and classes.
3. DOCUMENTATION - If you write down what things are named it'll be easier to not mess things up.
4. TESTING - Try out the site on multiple devices to make sure nothing looks off.
5. TESTING PART TWO - As a last check it's good to develop Selenium tests to see if your stuff will break when used by the public.
